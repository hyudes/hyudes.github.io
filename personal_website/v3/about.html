<h1>A bit about the website - and me </h1>

 <h2>My love of ice cream runs DEEP. I was born into a family that savored ice cream for breakfast on waffles or after dinner for dessert. In highschool when I was searching for an extra income, it is no suprise that I ended up working at a homemade ice cream store in Boston called White Mountain Creamery. Here, I went from newbie to connoisseur. My favorite flavor from there is called Cookie Monster, which is a combination of all of their cookie flavors. Needless to say, I have a thing for the mix-ins.<h2>

 <p>Use this website to explore ice cream shops that fit your taste buds and style. A few points that I feel needed explaining:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>Price is determined by how much a small costs. <$2 = $, <$3=$$, <$4=$$$, <$5=$$$$, <$6=$$$$$ </li>
  <li>Overall rating is shown by the number of ice cream cones and is out of 5. 5 pretty much means that this is one of the best spoonfuls of cream you've ever had in your entire life< /li>
</ul>
